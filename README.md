## More CV Details of this project ##
This project incorporates Computer Vision to detect defects on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs).

### Track defects:

When a defect occurs in a PCB, it will cause a large amount of current to flow through the traces.
This causes the traces to heat up quickly. Using Thermal Camera and CV, the heat flow within the PCB can be located and tracked.

This video shows the heat emission as a large current flows through the wire.
